                Hello! I am a high schooler on a journey to become a professional CMMC Compliance worker. Currently, I
                have
                1+ years of technical experience in software applications, cloud computing, technology infrastructure,
                and
                AI development. I have a goal; it is to have the skills and knowledge needed to secure our nation’s
                information from hackers and terrorists. I’ve always been fascinated by technology and how it can be
                improved. I have 1 year of internship experience with FabricLake & ProdigyBuild. In that time frame, I
                have
                provided security maintenance, web development, and built many chatbots. I am experienced at using
                Wordpress
                and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for the technical and web security services. Currently, I am focused on
                DoD/
                DoJ, state and local government compliance requirements with FedRAMP, StateRAMP, SP NIST 800-171 and
                CMMC
